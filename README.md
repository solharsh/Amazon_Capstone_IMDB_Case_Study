Predict whether the movie or the TV show is going to be nominated or win an award






Assuming the role of lead data scientist in 2005, you're presented with a challenge: Amazon Studios wants to produce award-winning films and, therefore, focus the budget on projects with the best chance of winning those awards. Using the actual dataset from IMDb, an Amazon subsidiary, you begin your investigation by looking for movies made between 1990 and 2005.

The IMDb dataset is a feature-rich, comprehensive listing of all films released during that time period; it includes critical data such as cast and crew, synopsis, and other production data. Much of this data is published on the public IMDb.com site, while other features are embargoed for studio analytics.

Your task is to predict which movies will most likely be nominated for an award during the upcoming 2005 awards season by building an awards analysis prediction model.






This is a notebook in which we read in fields of data from the IMDB database and build a model to make predictions of whether the movie is "nominated" or "Winner".
